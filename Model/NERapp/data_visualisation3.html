 into the appropriate lengths specified in materials list remove separate pack and accessories from frame hold onto the fabric pack because you can sew the shoulder straps back on to make a nice frameless pack drill holes use expensive titanium bit you wont regret it at crossintersections to slip bolts through conduit and backpack frame helpful hint 1 do not predrill all holes attempted this may seem superior but it is not it is very hard to drill perfect holes separately and have them all line up actually its damn near impossible drill one hole and attach the new piece to the frame with this hole and a bolt lockring washer combo now line up the next intersection and drill through both pieces at the same time this will save you from having to redrill holes and buying a new drill bit they wear out when drilling through

 helpful hint 2 its hard to start a new hole on the round surface of the conduit grab a hammer and anything sharp and as hard as the conduit hammer in a dimple to get the drill bit to bite helpful hint 3 from engr 114 course  wed like to emphasize not predrilling all holes instead drill and connect each bolt before proceeding to drill the next hole this will also ensure that the conduit does not accidentally move when drilling subsequent holes weave lateral 3 length of metal conduit through the curved part of the pack frame attach each bolt assembly before drilling the next hole to ensure that the holes are in the appropriate places set 3 lateral length of metal conduit on what will be the top side of the trailer at its front 2 forward of the endpiece of conduit installed in step 3 attach conduit to pack frame on center using 4 eyebolt assemblies 1 lockring 2 hexnuts and washers per again if a flat top is preferred use the regular bolt assemblies here set 4 twofoot conduit pieces on the underside of the 3 laterals space them exactly the necessary width for the wheel mounts clamps may be useful to secure hold the conduit as you mark the holes youre going to drill assemble conduit pieces using bolts alternate suggested order of operations from engr 114 connect each bolt as you drill the holes first connect bottom 3 length of conduit then the top 3 length then the outer 2 lengths for the wheel wells then attach the angle bracket to the outer lengths for the drop outs next place wheel into the that drop out to measure the exact placement of inner 2 wheel well conduit lengths and their respective angle brackets after marking exact locations attach angle bracket to the inner length check measurement again with the wheel in place and then finally attach the inner 2 lengths wheel mounts     use a 12 drill bit titanium not necessary as

 angle bracket that the wheels can easily slide in and out of but are small enough that the wheel can be securely attached without falling out the angle bracket will be oriented like a 7 rather than like an l with the top arm of the seven bolted underneath the 2 lengths of the wheel wells drill holes in angle bracket and conduit to attach using bolts make sure you align the wheels slightly back of the balance point for a more stable trailer also make sure they are not too far back so the wheel doesnt hit the rear lateral support bar suggestion 1 from engr 114 align and mark spacing of angle brackets on the conduit while they are attached to the wheels this will ensure that the spacing is perfect for the size of that particular wheel sometimes a front wheel and a back wheel of the same bike will have different sized axles suggestion 2 make sure that the plane of the top edge of the angle bracketwhen it is attached to the 2 length is the same as the plane of the bed of the trailer and that the all four angle brackets are also on the same plane  these steps will ensure that your wheels are not tilted inwards or outwards tongue side attachment or seatpost attachment that is the question this trailer attaches at the seatpost victor of the amazing hsu bicycle learning center says that the side attachment system tows more nicely you can choose to do either just keep your turning radius in mind when bending the tongue ill make another prototype trailer with a side attachment and post the direction on this page sometime in the future  bend the conduit tongue in an s shape so that it clears the wheel and the trailer rides level this takes some fine tuned adjustment pole benders are available at ace for about 24 or you could just use the fork in two trees to bend them as russell decided to do after seeing the price of the pole bender almost as expensive as the whole trailer only buy if you are planning on making a few trailers hammer the small piece of

 will never budge i wrapped the eyescrew in tape to that it would be quieter when locked into the carabiner                  hitch     when designing the hitch i toyed around with all kinds of complicated mechanisms indeed there are just as many complicated hitches designed for prefabricated trailers what i settled on was overly simple durable and functional you simply clip the eye bolt of the trailer into a carabiner that is attached to the seat post of your bike via hose clamps this allows any motion possible without restraint tape the protruding hose clamp tabs for protection against scrapeageunless you want to show of your hardcore trailer towing battle wounds to throw in a few other considerations bikes at work compares three different hitch styles  costs these are the costs for this particular tailer your particular costs may vary  backpack frame 5 at the arcata recycling depot check pawn shops as well you could potentially substitute the frame with a couple more pieces of conduit and a plywood deck conduit i got this free from a construction dumpster for free but brand new it is about 450 for a 10ft length at ace and 230 at home depot youll need two lengths so 10 bike wheels i went down to the bike library and pulled the parts for these out of the pit a pit full of random bike parts tossed in for later sorting cost 4 for 2 wheels bolts and hardware surprisingly expensive because i used

 20 cheaper if you know how to weld and have access to a welder cheaper still if you only have access to a welder the trailer not the raw materials just joking corner bracket free if you chat it up with bonnie at arcata scrap and salvage very cheap otherwise 2 drill bits 310 carabiner and hose clamps 5 total 40 for me if you bought everything new you could spend around 70100 labor 5 hours for the mechanically inclined use   a crate or plastic container with a top works well as a cargo bed secure your load on the trailer by hooking bungees on the eyebolts notice the hardcore trailer towing specialist the trailer built by engr 114 is now available for community use at the ccat at humboldt state university  more information this project was featured in the community wheel of hsu green wheels in fall 2006 for another heavy load option check out xtracycles here is a great review of the xtracycle or sport utility bicycle sub from riding the spine  other designs see more at bike trailers  community bike cart design  plans for two lowcost models of bike cart includes a few different hitch options xtracycle  domestic bicycle lifestyle advocates and customized carrier options interwiki links wikipediabike trailer    </div>
