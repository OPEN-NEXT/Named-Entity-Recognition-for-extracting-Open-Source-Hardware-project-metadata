Insert injection molding involves encapsulating a previously fabricated component in molten resin to produce a finished part. The inserted component is usually a simple object, such as a knife blade or surgical tube, but in some cases, inserts can be as complex as a battery or motor.#
Plastic insert molding is ideal for improving the strength and reliability of a component and can help save on cost and production time by eliminating the need for secondary operations such as soldering, connectors, and adhesives.
Overmolding is a two-step process where a plastic layer is molded over and around a previously molded part to produce a single component. Similar to this, insert molding involves joining separate parts to form a single component, but the difference is that the insert molding process is only a single step. The preformed insert and molten resin are placed in a mold together to combine two parts.
Insert injection molding is similar to other molding methods, but there are some differences between each of the processes. Injection molding involves injecting one or more molten plastic resins into a mold to create a single finished part.
Insert molding (or “insert moulding”) is just one of the many specialized plastic injection molding services Stack Plastics offers. Using highly-advanced vertical molding machines, our process achieves tight tolerances to ensure correct formation of the plastic parts. 
To guarantee that the metal insert parts match your specifications, we’ve forged sound working relationships with numerous vendors who supply us with high-quality metal insert components. We will also work with customer-supplied inserts, as your project requires.
