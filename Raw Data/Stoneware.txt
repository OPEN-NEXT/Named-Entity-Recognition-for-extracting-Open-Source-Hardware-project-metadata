Stoneware is a rather broad term for pottery or other ceramics fired at a relatively high temperature.A modern technical definition is a vitreous or semi-vitreous ceramic made primarily from stoneware clay or non-refractory fire clay.
Whether vitrified or not, it is nonporous (does not soak up liquids); it may or may not be glazed.
Historically, across the world, it has been developed after earthenware and before porcelain, and has often been used for high-quality as well as utilitarian wares.
