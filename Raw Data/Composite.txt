A composite material (also called a composition material or shortened to composite, which is the common name) is a material which is produced from two or more constituent materials.
These constituent materials have notably dissimilar chemical or physical properties and are merged to create a material with properties unlike the individual elements. Within the finished structure, the individual elements remain separate and distinct, distinguishing composites from mixtures and solid solutions.
There are various reasons where new material can be favoured. Typical examples include materials which are less expensive, lighter or stronger when related to common materials.
